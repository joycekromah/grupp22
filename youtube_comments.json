      "Propaganda is one of the most powerful tools of control, often used by those in positions of power to manipulate public opinion and maintain their dominance. It shapes perceptions, distorts reality, and can even create false narratives that serve the interests of a select few, rather than the common good. History shows that strong figures rarely act in the true interest of the people; more often than not, they are focused on consolidating their own power. Leaders may claim to serve the masses, but their actions often benefit the elites, leaving the public to absorb the consequences. This cycle is perpetuated through strategic manipulation of information, making it crucial for us to stay vigilant, question narratives, and seek truth beyond the surface.",
      "Brilliante Interview Partner, brilliantes auf den Punkt gebrachtes Interview, super gemacht Frau Dr. Weidel und Herr Musk 👏👏👏👏👏",
      "Nur die AFD kann Deutschland noch retten 💙. Es ist 5 vor 12 , wer dies nicht erkennt ist blind vor dem was aktuell mit Deutschland passsiert. Gute Politiker wie Helmut Schmidt haben vor Jahren davor gewarnt was falsche Migrationspolitik für Folgen haben wird. Auch Peter Scholl Latour hat bereits gewarnt “ Wer halb Kalkutta aufnimmt, muss sich nicht wundern wenn er selbst zu Kalkutta wird”. Die Ampelpolitik sorgt mit Ihren Massnahmen das die deutsche Wirtschaft zugrunde gerichtet wird. Diese Ampelpolitiker hassen Deutschland, wir waren einmal ein Land der Dichter und Denker.Übrigens gehöre ich ebenfalls zu der Minderheit von 87% die Gendern für absoluten Schwachsinn hält. Aber die deutsche Sprache zu verunglimpfen wird als Haupthema der Ampelpolitik angesehen, als ob wir keine anderen Probleme in Deutschland haben 😵‍💫.",

      "10:20 german government did switch of the last powerplant NOT because they are stupid BUT because its not that easy to install or renew a powerplant and that particular powerplant she is talking about would have needed atleast 5 years of repairment to be restartet. Again, pure bullshit she is talking",
      "1:10:15 Now we will pray for you too Alice 🙏🏻 But honestly it is so easy to find the truth and get all die answeres. Just read the bible from Genesis to Revelation ❤",
      "8:30 okay wind turbines need more space than a power plant. Who cares if you build them offshore? Who cares if u still have enough space onshore? What is important is that wind turbines do not produce nuclear waste and they procude waaaaaaay cheaper electricity. thats a fact",

      "Elin Musk needs to talk to Ray Comfort.",
      "German here - I agree with Weidel that Merkel und the Traffic Light Coalition brought Germany in a bad situation, both economically and societally. I am sure the AfD would correct many mistakes that Merkel/Traffic Light Coalition did. Yet they would introduce many other problems. They are not concerned with reunionizing Germany. Their rhetoric is clearly divisive and often drives people from the center or left to react with extreme rejection toward moderate right-wing politics.\n\nWe need common sense, unity. We need to distance us from stupid left wing identity politics. We need to make sure to keep up with the ever faster technological development and upcoming technological/industrial revolution both as an economy and society.\n\nThe AfD is definitely not a step forward over the sum of issues. On some - immigration, energy politics, identity politics - YES they are right on target, and for that I owe them some kind of thank you, they definitely brought some fresh wind. But regarding many other concerns, the AfD sucks pretty hard.\n\nPoints where the AfD sucks:\n- close bonds to russia  \n- often anti scientific position (to me it seems like right-wokeness in a sense of factual denial)\n- too conservative (abortion, ...)\n- too hardcore anti-EU sentiment\n- minimal support for social equality",
      "You can hear how shlomo hijacked the afd too",
      "Alice Weidl is a shame for Germany. She and her ridiculous fellow AfD politicians, take people for fools and unfortunately enough people are buying the lies they are telling. It's ridiculous. I cant even believe, thats she thinks that even 1% of the sh**t she talks is true. AfD is the end of democracy, the end of german economy, the end of freedom and peace. \nThe AfD is f***ing disgusting",

      "You can’t pigeon hole a nation, but when holidaying abroad and encountering German holiday makers, I’m always struck by how polite and well mannered they are, their values seem to be set in place and having respect for your parents is paramount. I hope they don’t become the toxic shithole that many of our major cities have become, and I hope they hold on to their identity and values too.",
      "The problems are real. Also it is true, that none of the political parties have been part of any federal government the last 20 years can, will and or at least want to solve the problems. What I miss in this conversation is a solution. No real solutions have been discussed so far. And another problem is, that the media in Germany is too focused on political parties, which are already part of the parliament. For me it is not important who solves the problem, but that the problems get solved quickly. And there are more options in Germany than the AfD. I personally don't want to miss the Euro, the Schengen Agreement or the NATO. But due to a fatal fail of the media in Germany and the combating of the freedome of speech AfD is currently the only option for change. Many of my friends an I myself think about 2025 if CDU, SPD, FDP or Die Grünen wins the election or plays a major role in the next government: Braindrain. Yes, we are in!",
      "Afd is like cancer of germany that you think you git rid of but its reappearing after 76 years",
      "Hitler was not a communist, that is so incredibly wrong",
      "50 Min. Great answer Elon 👍",
      "I am German/spaniard and was borned here in Germany. \nit is very frustrating for me to read the comments and how the people abroad think about them!\nshortly:the afd  are racists and want the \"fourth reich.\"\n especially one of their afd member \"björn höcke \",who wrotes a very controverse and similar book\"alles für Deutschland \" to \"mein kampf /hitler\".\nabout that fact,she is not talking.oh, wonder Why????you can google about that.\nshe lied about  the Nazi History and about their \"Good willing \" for germany!!!\nhitler was not a Communist, he was a f***n  racist  and mudered millions of human beeings.also he destroyed germany and traumatized until today  many,many,people!!!!!\nPlease don't believe her and elons very weird conspiracy Theory!!!!\nit's not true!\nthe only intelligent way is not to Vote for them and not to  believe their b***t!!!!",

      "Both racists - Elon comes from a country where apartism kills people and Alice is more right-wing than the man from Austria who is responsible for millions of murders. The NSDAP was a right-wing party and remains so - just like your party. This is the nightmare for Germany.",
      "Nothing will change if AFD comes to Power. They will prostitute themself like any other party. No one has the intend to change the system when they can profit of it.",
      "The next Goebbels family?",
      "3:30 fun fact. Germany renewable energy contains \"only\" around 20 - 25% solar energy. Most of it comes from wind from offshore and onshore parcs followed by waterenergy and biomass. so by saying \"you dont have to be smart to understand that this cant work\" Alice called out herself as being stupid. But thats normal for her and the AfD, leaving out crucial information",
      "Zusammenfassung: Weidel lästert 2,5 Stunden über ihr eigenes Land",
      "I hope the non-germans listening to this do not believe weidel and Musk. This is pure populism and in (almost) no way even close to the truth. I beg you: educate yourself from more than 1 source and maybe look at the state of Germany from a neutral source. Not this.",

Now, there may be some aspects of culture which need to be looked at to try to track these despicable people down. But why only look at Muslim culture(s)? Why not the white working class cultures of Lancashire, or the Pennines? Or the toffee nosed cultures of MPs? Or white clergy in the aisles of churches? \n\nIt's a challenging question but I think that there is a whole group of white upper class, middle class and working class men, who find comfort in being able to project their own paedophiliac urges onto an already marginalised group of men from a different culture.\n\nIn fact, the likes of Jenson, Farage, Tommy Robinson and random pale face munching on a sausage roll or bacon butty across the street, harbour paedophiliac urges, just as much as any brown faced curry eating Muslim.\n\nPaedophilia is beyond the pale.

Criminality is NOT skyrocketing in Germany. It's simply a LIE. And NO, German education is not just about gender identity. It's barely mentioned at school. She needs to take a couple seats.

      "Elon Musk you are a clever cookie and I am sure you done lots of research before you intended to build factories in Berlin. Elon Germans have been bureaucrats since Bismarck’s time, so if you don’t like it don’t do business in Germany.. AFD is far right, the are neo Nazis, sure weidel  will not admit to it, we had similar speeches before 1930, I grew up in Berlin and recall all the migrants have been vital for the economy, they helped mit dem wirtschafts wonder. And finally since when is a yank/South African telling the Germans or any other nation how to vote.",
      "She didn’t mention a single concrete action they’d take if they were leading the country—just blaming other parties for what they supposedly did wrong. That’s what they always do because they have no real plans, no actual program. The only thing that unites them is their hate for anyone who isn’t “German by blood.” They just say whatever people want to hear, and sadly, that works nowadays, masking their true intentions. It’s honestly scary how much this feels like history repeating itself—just like in the 1930s when people thought, “The NSDAP can’t be that dangerous.” And yes there is a lot to blame in german politics the last years, but the AFD is not the solution but an even bigger problem",

Thanks Internet.",
      "Wow, DW really is concerned that two people should exercise their right to free speech and offer an opinion. We know the real problem is that Musk is highlighting the failures of the EU and the establishment and making them accountable.",

      "\"Ich möchte eine Erklärung zu diesem Thema abgeben. Das größte Hindernis für große Unternehmen weltweit ist die Europäische Union. Vor allem Elon Musk und ähnliche Persönlichkeiten wollen die EU zerschlagen und Gesellschaften schaffen, die von Unternehmen geführt und gestaltet werden. Ein Professor der New York University hat eine originale Studie zu diesem Thema. In den USA gibt es 3600 traditionelle Bäckereien. In Frankreich liegt diese Zahl jedoch bei 33.000. Die Europäische Union ist der Maßstab für eine gute und gesunde Zukunft sowie für die Werte und die Qualität der Menschheit. Ein einfaches Beispiel ist, dass durch eine Regelung der EU alle Unternehmen dieselben Ladegeräte für Telefone verwenden. Solche ähnlichen Impulse, wie zum Beispiel für die öffentliche Gesundheit, Arbeitszeiten, Wettbewerb und viele andere Themen, sind weltweit Beispiele der Europäischen Union. In Wirklichkeit sind es oft Zeiten, in denen der Nationalismus wächst und die Menschen in Angst nach praktischen Lösungen suchen, was zu falschen gesellschaftlichen Entscheidungen führt. Deshalb werden die Menschen durch soziale Medien und Ängste gesteuert. Elon Musk hat uns dies als klares Beispiel gezeigt. Ich könnte dies mit vielen weiteren Beispielen erklären, aber meine Zeit und mein Sprachvermögen reichen für dieses Thema nicht aus. Deshalb wollen sie weltweit, dass praktisch orientierte, pragmatische Führungspersönlichkeiten, die auf Unternehmen fokussiert sind, die Führung übernehmen. Eine große Gefahr für die Menschheit sind Machtzentren, die Geld verwalten, aber deren Werte noch nicht gefestigt sind.\"",

However, if intolerant people gain enough power, they might destroy the tolerant society by suppressing tolerance itself.\n\nThe idea is often linked to the philosopher Karl Popper, who argued that a tolerant society must sometimes limit its tolerance. Specifically, it should not tolerate acts or beliefs that aim to destroy tolerance or harm others.\n\nIn simple terms: To protect tolerance, we may need to set boundaries against intolerant behavior.\n\n\n* The first Sentance was Clickbait with a fictive value.",

Can someone from DW explain this to me? Or is it that there is only democracy for the right opinion? Seems pretty communist to me but maybe I read my history books wrong.
