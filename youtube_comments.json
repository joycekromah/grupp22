      "Propaganda is one of the most powerful tools of control, often used by those in positions of power to manipulate public opinion and maintain their dominance. It shapes perceptions, distorts reality, and can even create false narratives that serve the interests of a select few, rather than the common good. History shows that strong figures rarely act in the true interest of the people; more often than not, they are focused on consolidating their own power. Leaders may claim to serve the masses, but their actions often benefit the elites, leaving the public to absorb the consequences. This cycle is perpetuated through strategic manipulation of information, making it crucial for us to stay vigilant, question narratives, and seek truth beyond the surface.",

Gute Politiker wie Helmut Schmidt haben vor Jahren davor gewarnt was falsche Migrationspolitik f√ºr Folgen haben wird. Auch Peter Scholl Latour hat bereits gewarnt ‚Äú Wer halb Kalkutta aufnimmt, muss sich nicht wundern wenn er selbst zu Kalkutta wird‚Äù. Die Ampelpolitik sorgt mit Ihren Massnahmen das die deutsche Wirtschaft zugrunde gerichtet wird. Diese Ampelpolitiker hassen Deutschland, wir waren einmal ein Land der Dichter und Denker.√úbrigens geh√∂re ich ebenfalls zu der Minderheit von 87% die Gendern f√ºr absoluten Schwachsinn h√§lt.

      "Elin Musk needs to talk to Ray Comfort.",
      "German here - I agree with Weidel that Merkel und the Traffic Light Coalition brought Germany in a bad situation, both economically and societally. I am sure the AfD would correct many mistakes that Merkel/Traffic Light Coalition did. Yet they would introduce many other problems. They are not concerned with reunionizing Germany. Their rhetoric is clearly divisive and often drives people from the center or left to react with extreme rejection toward moderate right-wing politics.\n\nWe need common sense, unity. We need to distance us from stupid left wing identity politics. We need to make sure to keep up with the ever faster technological development and upcoming technological/industrial revolution both as an economy and society.\n\nThe AfD is definitely not a step forward over the sum of issues. On some - immigration, energy politics, identity politics - YES they are right on target, and for that I owe them some kind of thank you, they definitely brought some fresh wind. But regarding many other concerns, the AfD sucks pretty hard.\n\nPoints where the AfD sucks:\n- close bonds to russia  \n- often anti scientific position (to me it seems like right-wokeness in a sense of factual denial)\n- too conservative (abortion, ...)\n- too hardcore anti-EU sentiment\n- minimal support for social equality",

      "Alice Weidl is a shame for Germany. She and her ridiculous fellow AfD politicians, take people for fools and unfortunately enough people are buying the lies they are telling. It's ridiculous. I cant even believe, thats she thinks that even 1% of the sh**t she talks is true. AfD is the end of democracy, the end of german economy, the end of freedom and peace. \nThe AfD is f***ing disgusting",

      "You can‚Äôt pigeon hole a nation, but when holidaying abroad and encountering German holiday makers, I‚Äôm always struck by how polite and well mannered they are, their values seem to be set in place and having respect for your parents is paramount. I hope they don‚Äôt become the toxic shithole that many of our major cities have become, and I hope they hold on to their identity and values too.",
      "The problems are real. Also it is true, that none of the political parties have been part of any federal government the last 20 years can, will and or at least want to solve the problems. What I miss in this conversation is a solution. No real solutions have been discussed so far. And another problem is, that the media in Germany is too focused on political parties, which are already part of the parliament. For me it is not important who solves the problem, but that the problems get solved quickly. And there are more options in Germany than the AfD. I personally don't want to miss the Euro, the Schengen Agreement or the NATO. But due to a fatal fail of the media in Germany and the combating of the freedome of speech AfD is currently the only option for change. Many of my friends an I myself think about 2025 if CDU, SPD, FDP or Die Gr√ºnen wins the election or plays a major role in the next government: Braindrain. Yes, we are in!",

      "My sincerest hope is that people understand that MOST of what she said about Germany is a flat out LIE. To me it seems Musk had more respect for this country than she did. No German pays more than half of his or her taxes to the State. It is simply a LIE. The highest taxes among the OECD countries is paid in BELGIUM, not Germany. Criminality is NOT skyrocketing in Germany. It's simply a LIE. And NO, German education is not just about gender identity. It's barely mentioned at school. She needs to take a couple seats. All she did was bash her country. She criticized Merkel and the greens saying how they're either stupid or hate their country. Mistakes were made with regards to the energy. Nuclear power comes with problems. Yes, we need a solution. But under no circumstance is this a reason to ever vote for this party. Last but not listen, NO HISTORIAN will ever agree with her fantasy story that Hitler was a communist.",

The only thing that unites them is their hate for anyone who isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúGerman by blood.‚Äù They just say whatever people want to hear, and sadly, that works nowadays, masking their true intentions. It‚Äôs honestly scary how much this feels like history repeating itself‚Äîjust like in the 1930s when people thought, ‚ÄúThe NSDAP can‚Äôt be that dangerous.‚Äù And yes there is a lot to blame in german politics the last years, but the AFD is not the solution but an even bigger problem",

      "\"Ich m√∂chte eine Erkl√§rung zu diesem Thema abgeben. Das gr√∂√üte Hindernis f√ºr gro√üe Unternehmen weltweit ist die Europ√§ische Union. Vor allem Elon Musk und √§hnliche Pers√∂nlichkeiten wollen die EU zerschlagen und Gesellschaften schaffen, die von Unternehmen gef√ºhrt und gestaltet werden. Ein Professor der New York University hat eine originale Studie zu diesem Thema. In den USA gibt es 3600 traditionelle B√§ckereien. In Frankreich liegt diese Zahl jedoch bei 33.000. Die Europ√§ische Union ist der Ma√üstab f√ºr eine gute und gesunde Zukunft sowie f√ºr die Werte und die Qualit√§t der Menschheit. Ein einfaches Beispiel ist, dass durch eine Regelung der EU alle Unternehmen dieselben Ladeger√§te f√ºr Telefone verwenden. Solche √§hnlichen Impulse, wie zum Beispiel f√ºr die √∂ffentliche Gesundheit, Arbeitszeiten, Wettbewerb und viele andere Themen, sind weltweit Beispiele der Europ√§ischen Union. In Wirklichkeit sind es oft Zeiten, in denen der Nationalismus w√§chst und die Menschen in Angst nach praktischen L√∂sungen suchen, was zu falschen gesellschaftlichen Entscheidungen f√ºhrt. Deshalb werden die Menschen durch soziale Medien und √Ñngste gesteuert. Elon Musk hat uns dies als klares Beispiel gezeigt. Ich k√∂nnte dies mit vielen weiteren Beispielen erkl√§ren, aber meine Zeit und mein Sprachverm√∂gen reichen f√ºr dieses Thema nicht aus. Deshalb wollen sie weltweit, dass praktisch orientierte, pragmatische F√ºhrungspers√∂nlichkeiten, die auf Unternehmen fokussiert sind, die F√ºhrung √ºbernehmen. Eine gro√üe Gefahr f√ºr die Menschheit sind Machtzentren, die Geld verwalten, aber deren Werte noch nicht gefestigt sind.\"",

However, if intolerant people gain enough power, they might destroy the tolerant society by suppressing tolerance itself.\n\nThe idea is often linked to the philosopher Karl Popper, who argued that a tolerant society must sometimes limit its tolerance. Specifically, it should not tolerate acts or beliefs that aim to destroy tolerance or harm others.\n\nIn simple terms: To protect tolerance, we may need to set boundaries against intolerant behavior.\n\n\n* The first Sentance was Clickbait with a fictive value.",
