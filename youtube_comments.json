      "Alice Weidel talks even more BS when she speaks English. Her true thoughts are shown because she can only speak simple English.",
      "Musk turned on Germany now? mind how you go Germany, GB are investigating his actions in GB.",
      "Hitler was a socialist with a free market like China",
      "2:06 - Angela Merkel was part of the conservative CDU, she was not a \"green chancellor\"\n\n2:18 - Germanys borders were never closed, therefore she could not have opened them to \"illegal immigration\". Either she opened them to more (legal) immigration or she did nothing to them\n\n6:15 - Germany is literally continuing to \"produce\" more energy - through expanding solar and wind farms.",
      "🤡🤡🤡",
      "Die USA hat Deutschland (Europa) von den Nazis befreit,und jetzt rufen die Eliten der USA auf, Deutschland soll von Rechts(Nazis) wieder geführt werden😡Und das lässt die USA zu😂.Wie müssen sich die Veteranen fühlen daß sie sich für nichts geopfert haben.Was hat die USA davon🤔was hat Trump davon das zuzulassen.\n\nBis gestern habe ich die Russen zu tiefst gehasst,jetzt kann ich sie verstehen was sie über die USA sagen! Scheiß auf USA,ihr scheiß Nazis🤬🤬🤬😡😡😡🤬🤬😡😡😡🤬",
      "Only legal migration! Take the example of Poland, we have several million migrants (mainly from Ukraine and Belarus). Over a million war refugees who fled the war (russia is a terrorist country! ) in Ukraine. They all work to support our economy. Children from Ukraine study in polish schools, where teaching is in polish. These are migrants who are culturally close to us. They integrate into society, none of women wear burqas! It is safe and clean, a woman can walk safely through the city at night. No one molests women in swimming pools (which has happened many times in german cities). The Polish police are not afraid to control (in Germany the police will not enter many areas because they are afraid migrants). We support migrants with 800 zł (170€) per child per month, but we do not provide free housing! To have something, you have to work. Every migrant is welcome in Poland but they must work and integrate with society and above all obey local laws! In Poland we eat pork, women dress however they want.",
      "16:20 She is straight up lying here.\nThere is no \"wokeish\" or \"leftish\" agenda in schools. Teachers are by law required to teach objectively to preserve a neutrality. They are not even supposed to show signs of their religion like wearing a cross or a hijab.\nI know that there are some professors in uni who like gendered thesises, but that is not enforced in any government law. I don't think there is one professor like this where I am studying. And about the quality of our University education: of the top 100 Universitys worldwide, there are 8 in Germany. In comparison the US has 4.5 that much, but Germany is smaller than Montana. From my own experience I can only compare the German mechanical engineering with a South Korean one because of a semester abroad. Courses are very similar but the kind of teaching is different. In this case I had to archieve about the same but the theachers there weren't helping as much with exercises and preperation for the exams.\nAnd abot Schools: German kids are OECD average. Yes it got a bit worse, like in every other country, except for Japan.",
      "Anxious nicht Ainxious",
      "Ah yes, the AfD. The party of people who think Russia could be crazy enough to nuke Berlin. Of course they still want russian gas though, ain‘t nothing like trading with someone that regularly threatens to nuke your capital. \n\nThe best thing is how they want to isolate Germany, because of the economy. You heard that right, they believe isolationism is good for the economy. Political illiterates, the lot of them."

Admittedly, he never paused, so shout out your counter facts eg of course there are some cases in Cornwall etc. Lets compare? Numbers of abused,and tortured, racism proof, and percentage of abusers re population",
      "Mehdi id a complete dolt. To have the new to say to let him finish a sentence when he is just rudely ranting, interrupting nonstop and talking over Piers makes him look like a foolish AH. I have a feeling he is single because no one would be able to stand him.",

      "The cost of this will easily hit a half TRIILION. Why should the federal gov, aka, the taxpayer's money from 49 other states, be on the hook for this??? Yes, we cover natural disasters, tornadoes, floods, hurricanes, etc... but LEADERSHIP in those states have taken all conceivable measures possible to mitigate damage from such events. The people living in CA knowingly elected ignorant officials that DIRECTLY MADE THESE FIRES 100 TIMES WORSE!!!!! Maybe a thousand times worse than they would be naturally. They cut money from fire dept and waste it on illegals, they DONT DO CONTROLLED BURNS like other states and countries do to remove dead and dry debris, they hire mayors and fire chiefs based on DEI and who prioritize DEI instead of experience and qualifications, THEY DIVERT WATER AND INTENTIONALLY CAUSE WATER SHORTAGE to prioritize a 3\" smelt fish, etc... etc... So instead of a naturally occurring couple small acre fires in high wind, YOU DIRECTLY CAUSED the whole state to burn down! The US shouldnt lose another trillion over ineptitude/blue leadership. The people in CA knowingly elected these people! Let them reap the rewards!",
      "Wokeness certainly didn't help the situation",
      "*He's absolutely right!  The governor diverted precious water resources and demolished four dams that acted as reservoirs to 'protect fish!' Trump warned California about this EIGHT FREAKING YEARS AGO!*",
      "How do you know the fires are not part of a plot?",
      "Then why did you even mention her personal identity?",
      "She and newscum are to blame. They have been warned for years that the forests are in need of management to prevent or minimize losses",
      "Get a life 🙋🏻‍♂️",
      "Rumors, lies and hoaxes is whats MSNBC is all about. MSNBC is dying propaganda channel for the Dems. Wokeness is about denying fundamental reality, resentment and of coarse blaming others. LA County Fire has been fighting an ongoing losing battle trying to get affluent areas like Malibu to clear brush and trees which of coarse make those areas very beautiful. But if you get a dry high wind plus a fire it turns into an unstoppable blast furnace. It was no secret these destructive fires were inevitable.",
      "Young adults can be rebellious. So Elon's trans son tells \"dad\" to f-off, and Musk declares war on Woke. \"The Woke virus infected him.\" How many years will the World have to endure a Billionaire with a thirst for hatred?",
      "Billions given to Ukraine while leaving our southern borders open, and now this. America will not miss the worst president and vice president this country has ever had. Thanks Biden, Kamala and your subversive legacy media for leaving this country in worse shape than when you started."

Of course you have illegal immigrants like most developed nations, which the german government deals with.\n\nNext: she dunks on renewables, Elon stammers and is embarrassed.\n\nThen Elon gives his unqualified view on nuclear power, in a pod covering a country that has MANY highly qualified nuclear power plant designers and operators. \n\nWhat a crock.",
      "This is the authentic and smart discourse I've been waiting for a long time! Thank you so much! ... from Germany",
      "I think Alice Weidel skipped some English classes to learn about the woke mind virus",
      "This woman does not speak for a free germany. This woman embodies extremist right-wing nazi ideology and everything a democracy is not. I will not say fake news. She is manipulating historic facts and spreading lies. Both Musk and Weidel fool poor and uneducated people for their own influencial and economic benefit. Which is exactly what Hitler and his Nazis did with the labour party. Common people don't get a reward by following them. Only those who already have money and power and adapt their ideology gain a benefit. What is happening in so many countries right now in the world, is truly frightening. Do not believe in this. Don't buy s*it you don't need and don't sell freedom, truth, ethics, solidarity and democracy for it. We don't need a fourth reich neither in Germany nor in the US.",
      "Henry Ford, IBM ,IG Farben ,Fanta, Hugo Boss all \"great \" stories you should check out yourself and make your own conclusions ,unbiassed. Become a critical independant thinker able to withstand propaganda.........",
