I’m a Democrat, my immediate family and siblings are Democrats. We didn’t vote for Trump.\n\nLast night for me was my breaking point. I watched with my husband as fellow Democrats (ironically wearing pink for women) sat there either stone-faced or seething with disgust while the family of Laken Riley was honored and a young boy with cancer became an honorary secret service agent. \n\nI’m switching parties. It’s been coming for awhile, but that was the moment for me.\n\nI have a young family member that was the victim of assault, I have family in law enforcement, we have all been touched in some way by cancer, and I have not been able to come to terms with what I witnessed from Democrats last night. \n\nIt was surreal. It was like an episode of Scooby Doo where they pull off the masks and show you who the villains are. I literally couldn’t sleep last night. I can’t believe I’m saying this. But I’m done. As a woman, a mother, as a HUMAN, I’m just done. When I heard Nicole Wallace’s heinous remark I said to my husband “who are these people?!”\n\nThey don’t represent me anymore, or who I am. I can finally admit to myself that despite my personal dislike of Trump, I begrudgingly admit I support some of what he is actually doing. I can’t think of much I support that the Democrats have been doing for a long time, and frankly I don’t even know what they stand for now except the right to choose (which is no longer enough) and men having the right to invade what were once my personal spaces.\n\nI admit… I actually smiled when I saw the First Lady. I cried when the boy hugged the secret service agent. I realized I have so missed this quintessentially American feeling of pride. Pride for my fellow citizens, pride for my country. I’m flabbergasted at myself but it feels like a relief to admit all of this. I can’t say I’m MAGA…. but I know now after last night I am no longer a Democrat.\n\nBest, \nREDACTED"

E ele será apenas o primeiro de muitos. O ICE (Agência de Imigração e Alfândega) está pronto para acelerar as deportações, e a nova diretriz presidencial dá carta branca para uma limpeza ideológica nos campi americanos.\n\nMas a ofensiva não para por aí. Agora, as universidades que não tomarem medidas para proteger estudantes judeus também pagarão o preço.\n\nTrump ordenou o corte imediato de US$ 400 milhões em bolsas e contratos federais destinados à Universidade de Columbia, em Nova York. O Departamento de Educação declarou que a medida foi tomada por conta da “inação contínua” da universidade diante do “assédio persistente” a estudantes judeus.\n\nA Universidade de Columbia foi a primeira a sentir o impacto, mas outras podem ser as próximas. A administração Trump notificou que todas as universidades que não agirem contra manifestações antissemitas ou apoios velados ao Hamas terão seus fundos federais revisados.\n\nO governo está utilizando inteligência artificial para rastrear postagens em redes sociais e discursos públicos em busca de qualquer indício de apoio ao Hamas.
