Musk afirmou que a EcoHealth Alliance recebeu US$ 53 milhões da USAID para experimentos de ganho de função em coronavírus, o que teria contribuído para a pandemia de COVID-19.\n\nAlém disso, Musk criticou a agência por ser “um ninho de serpentes de marxistas de esquerda” e ordenou o bloqueio do site oficial e a exclusão da conta da USAID em sua plataforma X, que tinha quase um milhão de seguidores. Para ele, a agência promove propaganda global e deve ser desmantelada - uma clara  demonstração de sua rejeição ao que ele considera práticas antiéticas e perigosas promovidas pela USAID.\n\nMusk também destacou que a USAID foi infiltrada pela CIA, com agentes usando projetos no exterior para operações clandestinas. A agência tem sido ligada a intervenções políticas em países como Haiti, Ucrânia e Egito, levantando suspeitas sobre seu papel como ferramenta de influência geopolítica dos EUA.\n\nMais de 60 funcionários foram afastados na última semana por desobedecerem a ordens executivas que suspendem temporariamente a ajuda externa. A batalha entre Elon Musk, Trump e a burocracia federal lança uma luz sobre os bastidores da política externa americana. A USAID, historicamente vista como uma ferramenta de “soft power”, agora enfrenta o maior ataque à sua legitimidade desde sua criação, com seu futuro cada vez mais em xeque.\n\nMusk deixou um aviso: “Chega de corrupção disfarçada de ajuda humanitária.

This is going to require strong support from The President and Congress and the Judiciary, but it's possible. We have a $2T deficit. If we can get it cut in half to $1T and we can get economic growth to match that $1T there will be no inflation. Interest rates drop, and prices at the store stay the same. That is a GREAT outcome for people, and I think we can do it.\""
